### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) [pandas]
To understand, be familiar with and check the sanity of the given data, the first step is EDA. This project's initial data exploration has been carried out using the `pandas` python package. Here, in general, we are checking... 
 * Presence of any missing values 
 * Any unusual value (outliers) 
 * Incorrect values (e.g., sales column, we see -ve numbers)
 * Determine `categorical` and `numeric` columns
 * Determine dimensions of categorical columns and range of numeric columns
Note that these steps can be performed using `PowerQuery Editor` and/or excel; however, `pandas` makes it much easier and faster; on top of that, `pandas` can handle massive datasets.
